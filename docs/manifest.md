# Application Deployment Manifest

← [Back to Main README](../README.md) | 📋 [Schema Reference](manifest-schema.md)

The Application Deployment Manifest is a YAML file that defines **what** your application is and **where** it should be deployed in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio.

> **Quick Reference:** For schema structure and validation rules, see [Manifest Schema](manifest-schema.md)

## What is an Application Deployment Manifest?

The manifest is a **declarative configuration** that defines:

- **Application identity**: Name and description
- **Content**: Code from git, data/models from storage
- **Activation**: How to run it (workflows, events, etc.)
- **Stages**: Where to deploy (dev, test, prod environments)
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings

### Who Owns What

- **Data Teams** own the manifest - Define what to deploy and where
- **DevOps Teams** own CI/CD automation - Define how and when to deploy

## Content Sources

Your application content can come from:
- **Git repositories** - for source code
- **Storage (S3)** - for data, models, large files
- **Both together** - common pattern for most applications

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Step 1: Create bundle archive
aws-smus-cicd-cli bundle --manifest manifest.yaml --output ./bundles/

# Step 2: Deploy the same bundle to multiple targets
aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --targets test --manifest myapp-v1.0.0.tar.gz
aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --targets prod --manifest myapp-v1.0.0.tar.gz
```

**What happens:**
1. `bundle` command packages all content (storage files + git repos) into a `.tar.gz` archive
2. `deploy` command extracts the archive and syncs content to the target project
3. Same archive can be deployed to multiple targets for consistency

**Best for:**
- Need versioned artifacts for audit trail
- Want to deploy the exact same artifact to multiple targets
- Require rollback capability
- Compliance and governance requirements
- CI/CD pipelines that create artifacts once, deploy many times

- **[Substitutions and Variables](substitutions-and-variables.md)** - Dynamic variable resolution in workflows
- **[CLI Commands Reference](cli-commands.md)** - Detailed command documentation

## Minimal Example

For simple use cases, the manifest can be very straightforward:

```yaml
applicationName: SimpleETLPipeline

# Application content to deploy
content:
  # Code from git repository
  git:
    - repository: etl-pipeline
      url: https://github.com/myorg/etl-pipeline.git
  
  # Data files from storage
  storage:
    - name: reference-data
      connectionName: default.s3_shared
      include: ['data/reference/']

# How to activate/run the application
content:
  workflows:
    - workflowName: etl_workflow
      connectionName: default.workflow_serverless

# Where to deploy
stages:
  test:
    stage: TEST
    domain:
      name: my-studio-domain
      region: us-east-1
    project:
      name: test-project
    deployment_configuration:
      storage:
        - name: reference-data
          connectionName: default.s3_shared
          stageDirectory: 'data'
```

This minimal example:
- Defines application code from git repository
- Includes reference data from S3 storage
- Creates a serverless Airflow workflow after deployment
- Uses an existing project (no bootstrap actions needed)
- Perfect for git-based workflows with data dependencies

## Comprehensive Example

This example demonstrates most features of the manifest:

```yaml
applicationName: MLTrainingPipeline

# Optional: Directory for storing bundle archives (local path or S3)
# Only used when creating bundles with `aws-smus-cicd-cli bundle` command
bundlesDirectory: s3://sagemaker-unified-studio-123456789012-us-east-1-domain/bundles

# Application content - what to include in deployments
content:
  # Application code from git
  git:
    - repository: MLTrainingPipeline
      url: https://github.com/myorg/ml-training.git
    - repository: SharedUtilities
      url: https://github.com/myorg/shared-utils.git
  
  # Models and data from storage
  storage:
    - name: pretrained-models
      connectionName: default.s3_shared
      append: false
      include: ['models/pretrained/']
      exclude: ['*.tmp', '.DS_Store']

# How to activate/run the application

  workflows:
    - workflowName: ml_training_workflow
      connectionName: default.workflow_serverless
    
    - name: training-data
      connectionName: default.s3_shared
      append: false
      include: ['data/training/']

## Content Section

The `content` section defines what to package and deploy to target environments.

### Bundle Storage Location

```yaml
bundlesDirectory: ./bundles  # Local directory
# OR
bundlesDirectory: s3://my-bucket/bundles  # S3 location
```

- **Local Storage**: Use for development and testing (`./bundles`, `~/bundles`)
- **S3 Storage**: Use for production and CI/CD systems
  - Centralized storage across teams
  - Version history with S3 versioning
  - Cross-region access
  - Integration with DataZone domain S3 buckets

### Storage Items

Package source code, libraries, and data files:

```yaml
content:
  storage:
    - name: code
      connectionName: default.s3_shared
      append: false
      include: ['src/', 'lib/', 'data/']
      exclude: ['.ipynb_checkpoints/', '__pycache__/', '*.pyc', '.DS_Store']
    
    - name: workflows
      connectionName: default.s3_shared
      append: true
      include: ['workflows/', 'dags/']
      exclude: ['.ipynb_checkpoints/', '__pycache__/', '*.pyc']
```

**Properties:**
- `name` (required): Unique identifier for this content item
- `connectionName` (required): S3 connection name in source project
- `append` (optional): Append to existing files (default: `false`)
- `include` (optional): Paths/patterns to include
- `exclude` (optional): Paths/patterns to exclude

**Best Practices:**
- Use `append: true` for workflows (incremental updates)
- Use `append: false` for source code (clean deployments)
- Always exclude temporary files: `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- Use descriptive names: `code`, `workflows`, `data`, `models`

### Git Repositories

Include Git repositories in your application content:

```yaml
content:
  git:
    - repository: MyDataPipeline
      url: https://github.com/myorg/data-pipeline.git
    - repository: SharedLibraries
      url: https://github.com/myorg/shared-libs.git
```

**Properties:**
- `repository` (required): Repository name (used in deployment path: `repositories/{repository-name}/`)
- `url` (required): Git repository URL

**Note:** Git repositories are always cloned to `repositories/{repository-name}/` in the bundle. No `targetDir` configuration needed.

### Catalog Assets

Request access to DataZone catalog assets:

```yaml
content:
  catalog:
    assets:
      - selector:
          search:
            assetType: GlueTable
            identifier: covid19_db.countries_aggregated
        permission: READ
        requestReason: Required for analytics pipeline
      
      - selector:
          search:
            assetType: GlueTable
            identifier: sales_db.customer_data
        permission: READ
        requestReason: Customer analytics
```

**Properties:**
- `assets` (required): List of catalog assets
- `selector.search.assetType` (required): Asset type (currently `GlueTable`)
- `selector.search.identifier` (required): Asset identifier (`database.table`)
- `permission` (required): Access level (`READ`, `WRITE`)
- `requestReason` (required): Business justification

**Deployment Process:**
1. Search for assets in DataZone catalog
2. Create subscription requests if needed
3. Wait for approval (up to 5 minutes)
4. Verify subscription grants
5. Fail deployment if access cannot be obtained

---

### Notebooks

Export and sync SageMaker Unified Studio notebooks across environments (bundle-deploy mode only):

```yaml
content:
  notebooks:
    enabled: true
    notebook_ids:        # Optional: specific notebook IDs to export
    - abc123def456       # When omitted, all active notebooks are exported
    - ghi789jkl012
```

**Properties:**
- `enabled` (required): Enable notebook export during bundle
- `notebook_ids` (optional): List of specific notebook IDs to export. When omitted, all active notebooks owned by the source project are exported. Each ID must match pattern `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,36}`.

**Stage-level configuration:**
```yaml
stages:
  prod:
    deployment_configuration:
      notebooks:
        disable: true    # Skip notebook sync for this stage
```

**Deployment Process:**
1. Bundle: Export notebooks from source project (StartNotebookExport → download .ipynb)
2. Deploy: Upload .ipynb files to target project's S3 shared bucket
3. Deploy: StartNotebookSync to create or update notebooks in target
4. Deploy: UpdateNotebook to apply name, description, metadata, parameters
5. Tracking: Each synced notebook is tagged with `smus-cicd-source-notebook-id` metadata

**Note:** Notebook sync requires the bundle-deploy workflow (`bundle` then `deploy`). Direct deploy without a bundle skips notebook sync silently.

---

## Target Section

Targets represent deployment environments (dev, test, prod). Each target defines domain, project, and environment-specific configurations.

### Basic Target Configuration

```yaml
stages:
  dev:
    stage: DEV
    domain:
      name: my-studio-domain
      region: us-east-1
    project:
      name: dev-marketing
```

**Required Properties:**
- `stage` (required): Deployment stage name (`DEV`, `TEST`, `PROD`)
- `domain.region` (required): AWS region where domain exists
- `project.name` (required): Project name in the domain

**Domain Identification (one of the following):**
- `domain.id`: Domain ID as shown in the SMUS portal — the easiest option for customers
- `domain.name`: Domain name
- `domain.tags`: Tag key-value pairs to look up the domain (all tags must match)

```yaml
# Option 1: domain ID (visible in the SMUS portal)
stages:
  dev:
    domain:
      id: dzd_xxxxxxxxxxxx
      region: us-east-1

# Option 2: domain name
stages:
  dev:
    domain:
      name: my-studio-domain
      region: us-east-1

# Option 3: tags
stages:
  dev:
    domain:
      tags:
        purpose: my-domain-tag
      region: us-east-1
```

### Bootstrap Actions

Configure environments, connections, and post-deployment workflows:

```yaml
stages:
  test:
    stage: TEST
    domain:
      name: my-studio-domain
      region: us-east-1
    project:
      name: test-marketing
    
    bootstrap:
      actions:
        - type: datazone.create_environment
          environment_configuration_name: 'OnDemand Workflows'
        - type: datazone.create_environment
          environment_configuration_name: 'Lakehouse Database'
        
        - type: datazone.create_connection
          name: s3-data-lake
          connection_type: S3
          properties:
            s3Uri: "s3://my-data-bucket/data/"
        
        # Automatically run workflow after deployment
        - type: workflow.run
          workflowName: etl_pipeline
          trailLogs: true  # Stream logs and wait for completion
```

**Project Properties:**
- `role` (optional): Customer-provided IAM role for the project
  - `arn`: IAM role ARN (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyProjectRole`)
  - Use `*` as wildcard for account ID: `arn:aws:iam::*:role/MyProjectRole` (replaced with current account)
  - The role must have a trust policy allowing DataZone and Amazon MWAA Serverless service principals
- `userParameters` (optional): Override project profile parameters
  - `EnvironmentConfigurationName`: Environment configuration to override
  - `parameters`: Array of name/value pairs

**Environments:**

          stageDirectory: 'repos'      # All git repos deploy here
      catalog:
        disable: false
```

**Properties:**

## Parameterization

The bundle manifest supports two types of parameterization:

1. **Manifest-level parameterization**: Environment variables in the manifest itself
2. **Workflow-level parameterization**: Parameters passed to workflow DAG files

### Manifest-Level Parameterization

Use environment variables in the manifest with `${VAR_NAME:default_value}` syntax:

```yaml
applicationName: ${APP_NAME:MarketingApp}

stages:
  dev:
    domain:
      name: ${DOMAIN_NAME:my-studio-domain}
      region: ${AWS_REGION:us-east-1}
    project:
      name: ${PROJECT_PREFIX:dev}-${TEAM_NAME:marketing}-project
```

**Usage:**
```bash
export DOMAIN_NAME=prod-datazone-domain
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
export PROJECT_PREFIX=analytics
export TEAM_NAME=datascience

aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --targets dev
```

**Resolution Rules:**
1. If environment variable is set: Use the value
2. If environment variable is not set: Use default value
3. If no default value: Use empty string

### Workflow-Level Parameterization

Parameters can be defined at two levels:

#### 1. Global Workflow Parameters

Defined in the `content.workflows` section, apply to all stages:

```yaml
content:
  workflows:
    - workflowName: marketing_etl_dag
      connectionName: project.workflow_mwaa
      parameters:
        data_source: s3://marketing-data/
        output_bucket: s3://marketing-results/
        timeout: 3600
```

#### 2. Stage Environment Variables

Defined in `stages[].environment_variables`, substituted in workflow files:

```yaml
stages:
  dev:
    environment_variables:
      S3_PREFIX: "dev"
      DEBUG_MODE: true
      MAX_RETRIES: 3
  
  test:
    environment_variables:
      S3_PREFIX: "test"
      DEBUG_MODE: false
      MAX_RETRIES: 5
```

### Using Parameters in Workflow DAG Files

Environment variables are substituted in workflow files using `${VAR_NAME}` or `$VAR_NAME` syntax:

```yaml
# workflows/dags/marketing_dag.yaml
my_dag:
  dag_id: "data_processing"
  tasks:
    extract_data:
      operator: "airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.s3.S3ListOperator"
      bucket: "my-data-bucket"
      prefix: ${S3_PREFIX}        # Resolves to "dev" or "test"
    
    process_data:
      operator: "airflow.operators.python.PythonOperator"
      python_callable: "process_data"
      op_kwargs:
        debug: $DEBUG_MODE       # Resolves to true or false
        retries: $MAX_RETRIES    # Resolves to 3 or 5
```

### Parameter Resolution Process

During deployment, the CLI:
1. Reads target's `environment_variables` configuration
2. Scans workflow files for `${VAR_NAME}` and `$VAR_NAME` patterns
3. Replaces variables with target-specific values
4. Uploads resolved files to the deployment environment

**Example Resolution:**

**Source workflow file:**
```yaml
prefix: ${S3_PREFIX}
debug: $DEBUG_MODE
```

**Dev target result:**
```yaml
prefix: dev
debug: true
```

**Test target result:**
```yaml
prefix: test
debug: false
```

### Supported Variable Types

Environment variables support multiple data types:

```yaml
environment_variables:
  STRING_VAR: "my-string"      # String value
  BOOLEAN_VAR: true            # Boolean value
  NUMBER_VAR: 42               # Numeric value
  PREFIX_VAR: "data/staging"   # Path/prefix strings
```

### Complete Parameterization Example

```yaml
applicationName: ${APPLICATION_NAME:DataApplication}

stages:
  dev:
    domain:
      name: ${DOMAIN_NAME}
      region: ${AWS_REGION:us-east-1}
    project:
      name: ${PROJECT_PREFIX}-dev-project
    
    # Environment variables for workflow file substitution
    environment_variables:
      S3_PREFIX: "dev"
      DEBUG_MODE: true
      MAX_RETRIES: 3
      DB_HOST: "dev-db.company.com"

content:
  # Global workflow parameters
  workflows:
    - workflowName: etl_dag
      connectionName: project.workflow_mwaa
      parameters:
        data_source: s3://data-bucket/
        timeout: 3600
```

**Workflow DAG file (`workflows/dags/etl_dag.yaml`):**
```yaml
etl_dag:
  dag_id: "etl_pipeline"
  default_args:
    retries: $MAX_RETRIES
  tasks:
    extract:
      operator: "airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.s3.S3ListOperator"
      bucket: "data-bucket"
      prefix: ${S3_PREFIX}
    
    transform:
      operator: "airflow.operators.python.PythonOperator"
      python_callable: "transform_data"
      op_kwargs:
        debug: $DEBUG_MODE
        db_host: ${DB_HOST}
```

**Final merged parameters for dev target:**
- From global: `data_source`, `timeout`
- From environment_variables (substituted in DAG): `S3_PREFIX`, `DEBUG_MODE`, `MAX_RETRIES`, `DB_HOST`

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields
- `applicationName` - A logical name for this CI/CD manifest environment — not a SMUS resource. This name can be anything.
- `content` with at least `workflows` defined
- `stages` (at least one stage)
- Each stage must have: `stage`, `domain.name`, `domain.region`, `project.name`

### Optional Sections
- `content.storage` - If omitted, no storage items to deploy
- `content.git` - If omitted, no git repositories to include
- `content.catalog` - If omitted, no catalog assets to subscribe
- `bundlesDirectory` - If omitted, defaults to `./bundles/` for bundle operations
- `bootstrap` - If omitted, assumes projects exist

### Connection Names
- Must match actual connection names in SageMaker Unified Studio projects
- Format: `{connection_name}` (e.g., `default.s3_shared`, `project.workflow_mwaa`)

### File Patterns
- Support glob patterns: `*.py`, `**/*.yaml`
- Exclude patterns take precedence over include patterns
- Paths are relative to content source directories

---

## Best Practices

### Application Content
- Always exclude temporary files: `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- Use `append: true` for workflows (incremental updates)
- Use `append: false` for storage (clean deployments)
- Use S3 storage for production and CI/CD systems
- Consider using git repositories for version-controlled source code

### Deployment Strategy
- **Bundle-based**: Use when you need versioned artifacts, audit trails, or rollback capability
- **Direct**: Use for simpler workflows, rapid iterations, or git-based deployments
- Both modes work with any combination of storage and git sources

### Stage Organization
- Use bootstrap actions only for non-production environments
- Keep production stages minimal and explicit
- Use consistent naming: `dev`, `test`, `prod`

### Parameterization
- Use manifest-level parameters for infrastructure configuration
- Use workflow-level parameters for application configuration
- Use environment variables for stage-specific values in workflows
- Always provide default values for optional parameters
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `DEV_DOMAIN_REGION` not `REGION`)

### Workflow Parameters
- Define common parameters globally
- Override with stage-specific parameters for environment differences
- Use environment variables for values that change per stage
- Avoid hardcoded values - use parameters instead

### Connection Management
- Create connections during bootstrap for new projects
- Use descriptive connection names
- Document connection requirements in project README
- Test connections after creation

## Terminology Glossary

### Application Deployment Manifest
YAML file that declares:
- **WHAT**: Application identity, dependencies, and configuration
- **WHERE**: Targets where the application should run (dev, test, prod)

### Application
The data/analytics workload being deployed (ETL workflows, ML models, APIs, etc.)

### Target
Environment where application runs (dev, test, prod). Each target specifies a domain, region, and project.

### Content
The application content to deploy, which can include:
- **Workflows**: Airflow DAGs or other workflow definitions
- **Storage**: Files and directories from S3 or local paths
- **Git**: Source code from git repositories
- **Catalog**: DataZone catalog assets

### GitHub Workflows
CI/CD automation that defines:
- **HOW**: Deployment mechanism (bundle-based, branch-based, etc.)
- **WHEN**: Deployment triggers (on push, on schedule, manual, etc.)

### Deployment
Process of promoting application to a target (executed by GitHub workflows)

### Separation of Concerns
- **Data/science teams** own: Application Deployment Manifest (what & where)
- **CI/CD/platform teams** own: GitHub workflows (how & when)

### Why "manifest"?
- Standard term in infrastructure-as-code (Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform)
- Implies declarative configuration
- Short and familiar in CLI usage (`--manifest`)
